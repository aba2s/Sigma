PostgreSQL
----------
In this project, we are using PostgreSQL as our database. Django supports PostgreSQL 12 and higher.
psycopg 3.1.8+ or psycopg2 2.8.4+ is required, though the latest psycopg 3.1.8+ is recommended.

.. admonition:: Note!

   Support for psycopg2 is likely to be deprecated and removed at some point in the future.
   **Changed in Django 4.2:** support for psycopg 3.1.8+ was added.

Refer to initial to django set up to see how to add postgresql as database in settings file.
